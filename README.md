# ABANDONED!
There where to many flawes in the arcitecture that would require a rewrite, and there are so many better projects out there, that I reccomend some of those :)

For example here are many examples: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20839622/notifications-for-new-github-project-releases

# Releaser

A small Angular4/Firebase app that monitors GitHub repositories for new releases, and sends you an email whenever it does :)
*(Note the code that does the actual processing of new repos and sending email is not up-to-date)*

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
